# CE889-Neural-Network-for-Rocket-Landing-Game-No-External-Libraries-
  ---  This project implements a feed-forward neural network with backpropagation from scratch, without external libraries. It trains the network to control a rocket's landing in a simulated game using data collected from manual gameplay. The trained network is then used to guide the rocket's landing in real-time.
